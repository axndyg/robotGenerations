# robotGenerations
Submitted final for my Object-Oriented Programming Class. 

## About
A replication of Harvard University 1968 experiment dealing with artificial intelligence tested through the use of the C language. The experiment demonstrated the evolution of artificial intelligence by favoring robots developed with better equipped attributes. This project is a direct reproduction of the experiment done in 1968 with the lanugage C++. 

## Notices and Errors
The program runs fine with basic compilers. Some compilers throw issues with the way raw string data has been formatted in my code. As well, warnings may raise from strict / exclusive C++ 11 features and C++ 11 extensions. To run seamlessly, replit is an issueless compiler for this code. 

### Crediting
All code is written by myself, with instruction and knowledge from my professor. All asci art found in the code are from the ASCI Library.
